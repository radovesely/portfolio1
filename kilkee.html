             Killkee is the spa located in the north of the Ireland. Our goal was to change their website and mach the style with their customer needs.We went trough the long process until we achieved the right visual identity.We started we the basics like a mood board, color palette , little redesigning the logo and creating style tile.After we had the basics and little vision about our desired design, we came up with very minimalistic idea of the website. We made a prototype with very simple layout and minimalistic design. Colors were very bright and calm. We also create real website based on the prototype what is quite similar.
