            <p class="process1"> My given style was the Optical art. The mix of patterns, lines and colors creating different optical illusions. My first question was how am I going to achieve to connected my type of style with given style. I started to do a research and collect pictures. I made mood board as a first visual idea what I kind of liked. The bigger issue was to create a logo, because for me was really difficult to sketch a logo with a touch of optical illusion. I came up with idea of the logo when I had to put my glasses on because my headstarted hurting after all these optical illusion. So I made a sketch of glasses with the well known illusionistic pattern. Next step was to vectorise it and make different versions. </p>
